            <p><b>Jayden was born on 2008 in New Zealand, and had shown talent for cricket at a young age. As a pitcher, his most well known play was an S curve in 2017 that had flew past Fuji Intermediate High School's batter, and secured the win by one point. After transitioning into AI Generated High, his skills as a pitcher translated suprisingly well into basketball during his PE classes, and after trying out basketball out of curiosity his junior years were spent landing "power shots" with his powerful triceps.

            <!--backstory cont-->
            As a senior, Jayden's reputation as a long-range marksman preceded him. Opposing teams were forced to adjust their defenses to accommodate his shooting range, often resorting to double-teaming him as soon as he crossed half-court. Yet, Jayden's adaptability and basketball IQ allowed him to find ways to create space for himself and his teammates, leading his team to multiple victories and establishing himself as one of the most exciting players to watch in high school basketball. With colleges already expressing interest in recruiting him, Jayden's future in the sport looked promising and filled with potential for further growth and success.

            <b><p>Perhaps his childhood has historically shown what kind of basketball player he was going to grow up into. According to him, he had always liked - and was successful in - RTS strategy games from a young age. He had often achieved in English not due to literacy-related talent, but his uncanny ability to guess what essay questions will pop up and to answer accordingly. After intense training in the basketball team, he had volunteered to become a point guard.
            <br><br>
            Despite having possibly the weakest physical performance in the entire Basketball team - evident by his low VPS - his tactical intellect has earned him the national nickname of the "Coach on the court." This is because in games, he would utilise his low weight and high agility to blitz through holes in the enemy defence, and re-enforce his own. Additionally, with his deep understanding of basketball theory, he would also become the main shotcaller, directing offensive plays through the holes he creates.

            Styles was born on the 14th of March 2009 in Libya before migrating to New Zealand in 2018. Intrested in the history of the world, he at first was a bookworm, speeding through the history of the world, and is on the path to become a history scholar. However, since he witnessed the basketball prowess from this school, he realized that this was his chance to go down in history as someone who combined the cunning of tacticians and quote: "the agility of a thief."
            <br><br>
            As a defensive specialist, Styles exhibits exceptional prowess in stealing and blocking, crucial elements of his defensive repertoire. His ability to anticipate plays and disrupt opponents is unmatched, while his agility and footwork add further dimensions to his defensive prowess. Complemented by stellar defensive efficiency metrics such as defensive rating and opponent field goal percentage, Styles emerges as a formidable force on the court. At present, however, he might pivot to a career in history, so make sure to support him in his games! We see a bright future in basketball for him.

            Formerly a rugby player, Phinehas Nyqvist was born on the 16th of July in Australia, where rugby is treasured like in New Zealand, Phinehas had adapted it's ways as if he mastered them. His powerful "Bull Charge" - as his community called it - had many intermediate schools caught off guard by it's power, such as Willetton Senior High, McKinnon Secondary college, and Sunshine Coast Grammar school.
            <br><br>
            Nyqvist has since made the switch for basketball after trying basketball with his friends, and had noticed how his Bull Charge interacts with basketball players to stunning effect. As a shooting guard, Phineas has become known for his ability to bulldoze through the typically lighter-built defenders, making him a force to be reckoned with on the basketball court. While he can shoot decently well, he prefers to pass to others as he believes that they have better accuracy than him.

            Born on the 13th of May 2008 in Japan, Muhammad had been a jack of all trades from a young age, not particularly proficient in a specific talent. After moving to New Zealand, however, he had begun to learn sports more, especially Basketball. Transitioning into AI Generated High due to his work ethic, he had joined the basketball club to find time to play it.
            <br><br>
            On the field, Muhammad is a versatile player on the team with a broad skillset, that sometimes catched opponents off guard. He may not be able to score three pointers from the defensive paint, power through defences, or do any mega crazy feat, but his jack of all trades quality makes him one of the go-to players on this team.

            A former gymnast with a hobby for streetball, Zorro was born on the 3rd of September 2008, in the suburbs of Miramar. There, basketball had been honed further into an unpredictable dance, with each player competing for themself. It was this dance where Zorro had trained in, learning the basics of gymnastics along the way. With these skills, Zorro was capable of many tricks that would later leave defenders starstruck in AI Generated High.
            <br><br>
            As a versatile center in AI Generated High, Zorro is known for an offense-heavy playstyle, involving "outplaying them with superior skill." In streetball, Zorro learnt the complex acrobats that he uses to twist and fakeout any defender in his way. This, in combination with his gymnastic skills, makes him a dangerous freelancer able to absorb defenders' focus like a sponge. Our career advisor sees a bright future in store for Zorro as an offensive force.

            Surprisingly, August was born in the Miramar, Wellington, the same suburb as Zorro Breckinridge. However, August would be more disliked in his community due to his strategy: he would first camoflauge into the basketball game itself, then steal the ball to score points of his own. On some occasions, this involved snagging the ball mid-air to score his own slam dunk! This tactic, later called "The Driveway," would be frowned upon in streetball for it's anticarry potential.

            But in AI Generated high, we observe that these manuvers take high agility, and had him scouted into our team. Since then, he has become a core part of our offensive team, especially in the event the team needs a comeback.
