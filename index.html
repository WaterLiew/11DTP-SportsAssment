            Coach of the year history
            -->
            <p>Liam was once a player in AI Generated High's junior basketball team since he joined in 1986, and later premier basketball in 1990, and had shown great sustained talent in the sport. As a power forward, he had used his immense build to power through many enemy teams, often scoring clutch points to win many games.
            <br><br>
            Liam's success continued as he graduated high school and attended AI college, where he had led his team into many appearances at nationals, and as a result he had broken the world record for the youngest MVP of the Year at 23 years old in 2009.
            <br><br>
            After suffering an injury to the ankle that left him unable to play, he puts his experiences as a player into inspiring many young players to give their all.</p>
